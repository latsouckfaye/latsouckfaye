Hi👋 

- I am Paul, a Data Engineer / Analyst. 

- 🔭 Passionate by Data Analysis and web development, I enjoy programming and automating routine tasks on web interfaces.

- 👨🏻‍💻 Last three years, I have worked on spatial analysis of seafloor data as part of my doctoral thesis. I have built Machine Learning based tools to automate seafloor geomorphologic mapping.

- ❤️ I also like to draw, write short narrative texts/poems, read, go for a run, travel to meet people and discover new places.
