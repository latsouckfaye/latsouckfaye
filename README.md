###### Hi👋, Paul here !

- 👨🏻‍💻 I am a Data Analyst / Engineer.
  
- 🔭 Currently, at the end of a Ph. D. thesis in Applied mathematics. Last 03 years, I have worked on spatial analysis of seafloor data and built predictive models for geomorphological maps.

- ❤️ Passionate by web development, I enjoy programming and automating routine tasks on web interfaces in my sparse time.​ I like to draw, write short narrative texts/poems, read, go for a run, travel to meet people and discover new places.
