Hi there! 👋 Welcome to my little corner of the web 🌍
I’m a Data Scientist 🧠✨ with a passion for solving complex problems and turning data into stories.

👨🏻‍💻 What I’ve been up to recently:
I’ve been diving deep (pun intended!) into the spatial analysis of seafloor data 🌊. I developed a Machine Learning-powered methodology to automate seafloor geomorphologic mapping and crafted statistical tools to make the process reproducible and reliable. If that sounds fancy, it’s because it is! 🚀

🎓 I hold a Master of Science (MS) degree in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Lille, France.

🔭 What excites me:
I’m all about automating workflows and building sleek, deployable apps for data analysis. There’s nothing more satisfying than creating tools that make complex tasks simple and scalable.

❤️ When I’m not crunching data:
You’ll probably find me exploring my creative side! I love to draw, write short stories and poems, read books that expand my perspective, run to clear my mind, or travel to meet amazing people and discover breathtaking places.

Let’s connect, build cool things, and make data dance! 💃📊
