###### Hi👋, Paul here !

- 👨🏻‍💻 I am a Data Analyst / Engineer.
  
- 🔭 Currently, I am at the end of a Ph. D. thesis in Applied mathematics. I have worked the last three years on spatial analysis of seafloor data.
- I built predictive models for geomorphological maps and provide machine learning based tools to automate the proposed methodology. I hope this work will be sooner published and available for the community.

- ❤️ Passionate by web development, I enjoy programming and automating routine tasks on web interfaces in my sparse time.​ I like to draw, write short narrative texts/poems, read, go for a run, travel to meet people and discover new places.
